In Java, relationships between classes, such as **one-to-one** or **one-to-many**, are typically represented using object references. These relationships are common in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and are implemented through instance variables (fields) or collections (like `List`, `Set`, or `Map`).

Hereâ€™s how you can define different types of relationships in Java classes:

---

### **1. One-to-One Relationship**
In a **one-to-one relationship**, one instance of a class is associated with exactly one instance of another class.

#### Example: **Person and Passport**
A person has exactly one passport, and a passport belongs to exactly one person.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private Passport passport; // One-to-one relationship with Passport

    public Person(String name, Passport passport) {
        this.name = name;
        this.passport = passport;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Passport getPassport() {
        return passport;
    }
}

class Passport {
    private String passportNumber;

    public Passport(String passportNumber) {
        this.passportNumber = passportNumber;
    }

    public String getPassportNumber() {
        return passportNumber;
    }
}

public class OneToOneExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Passport passport = new Passport("A123456");
        Person person = new Person("John Doe", passport);
        
        System.out.println(person.getName() + " has passport number: " + person.getPassport().getPassportNumber());
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`Person`** has a reference to **`Passport`**. Each `Person` object can be associated with one `Passport` object, and each `Passport` can be associated with exactly one `Person`.

---

### **2. One-to-Many Relationship**
In a **one-to-many relationship**, one instance of a class is associated with multiple instances of another class. In Java, this is typically represented using a collection like a `List` or `Set`.

#### Example: **Author and Books**
An author can write multiple books, but each book is written by only one author.

```java
import java.util.List;

class Author {
    private String name;
    private List<Book> books; // One-to-many relationship with Book

    public Author(String name, List<Book> books) {
        this.name = name;
        this.books = books;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public List<Book> getBooks() {
        return books;
    }
}

class Book {
    private String title;

    public Book(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
}

public class OneToManyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book book1 = new Book("Book 1");
        Book book2 = new Book("Book 2");
        List<Book> books = List.of(book1, book2); // Add multiple books to the list

        Author author = new Author("Jane Austen", books);
        
        System.out.println(author.getName() + " has written the following books:");
        for (Book book : author.getBooks()) {
            System.out.println(book.getTitle());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`Author`** has a list of **`Book`** objects, representing the one-to-many relationship. Each `Author` can have multiple `Book` objects, but each `Book` is associated with only one `Author`.

---

### **3. Many-to-One Relationship**
A **many-to-one relationship** is simply the reverse of a **one-to-many relationship**. Here, multiple instances of a class can be associated with a single instance of another class.

#### Example: **Student and School**
Many students belong to the same school.

```java
class School {
    private String name;

    public School(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

class Student {
    private String name;
    private School school; // Many students belong to one school

    public Student(String name, School school) {
        this.name = name;
        this.school = school;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public School getSchool() {
        return school;
    }
}

public class ManyToOneExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        School school = new School("Green Valley High");

        Student student1 = new Student("Alice", school);
        Student student2 = new Student("Bob", school);

        System.out.println(student1.getName() + " attends " + student1.getSchool().getName());
        System.out.println(student2.getName() + " attends " + student2.getSchool().getName());
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`Student`** objects have a reference to a **`School`**, representing a many-to-one relationship. Multiple `Student` objects can reference the same `School` object.

---

### **4. Many-to-Many Relationship**
In a **many-to-many relationship**, multiple instances of a class are associated with multiple instances of another class. This relationship is typically represented using collections (like `List` or `Set`) in both classes.

#### Example: **Students and Courses**
A student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.

```java
import java.util.List;

class Student {
    private String name;
    private List<Course> courses; // Many-to-many relationship with Course

    public Student(String name, List<Course> courses) {
        this.name = name;
        this.courses = courses;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public List<Course> getCourses() {
        return courses;
    }
}

class Course {
    private String courseName;
    private List<Student> students; // Many-to-many relationship with Student

    public Course(String courseName, List<Student> students) {
        this.courseName = courseName;
        this.students = students;
    }

    public String getCourseName() {
        return courseName;
    }

    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        return students;
    }
}

public class ManyToManyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating courses
        Course course1 = new Course("Math", null);
        Course course2 = new Course("Science", null);

        // Creating students
        Student student1 = new Student("Alice", List.of(course1, course2));
        Student student2 = new Student("Bob", List.of(course1));

        // Assign students to courses
        course1 = new Course("Math", List.of(student1, student2));
        course2 = new Course("Science", List.of(student1));

        System.out.println(student1.getName() + " is enrolled in: ");
        for (Course course : student1.getCourses()) {
            System.out.println(course.getCourseName());
        }

        System.out.println(student2.getName() + " is enrolled in: ");
        for (Course course : student2.getCourses()) {
            System.out.println(course.getCourseName());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`Student`** has a list of **`Course`** objects, and **`Course`** has a list of **`Student`** objects. This represents a **many-to-many** relationship. A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

### **Summary of Relationships in Java**

| **Relationship Type** | **Description**                                        | **Implementation**                                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **One-to-One**        | One object is associated with exactly one object.      | Use an instance variable to hold a reference to another object.               |
| **One-to-Many**       | One object is associated with multiple objects.        | Use a collection (e.g., `List` or `Set`) in the "one" side class.             |
| **Many-to-One**       | Multiple objects are associated with one object.       | Use an instance variable in the "many" side class to refer to the "one" side. |
| **Many-to-Many**      | Multiple objects are associated with multiple objects. | Use collections in both sides of the relationship.                            |

These relationships are fundamental in **Object-Oriented Programming** and can be modeled using object references and collections.
